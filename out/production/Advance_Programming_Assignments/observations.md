- Single player
- 5 Chances to hop and land on carpet of tiles
- Random Time may or may not win the soft toy
- Player Stores SoftToy in a Bucket
- After 5 Hops game ends and list of stuff won is printed

## Tale Carpet (Maybe ArrayList of Tiles)

- 20 Unique Tiles (So Logically Tile Class)
- Each Tile has Unique Soft Toy
- If Player lands on Even Tile directly Won
- If Player lands on Odd Tile he has to solve a question
    - If solved correctly you get the award
- Also Case in which he jumps too far handle all these things via exceptions

## Question Solving Using Calculator [\<T> :)]

- Handle Int and String
- For Int Divides
- For String Concatenates
- Firstly the player solves the calculator solves and answer is compared so ofc Random Number and String Generation must Take place outside the Calculator
- String option has random strings of length 4

## Bucket to Store Toys

- Tile creates clone of Toy and gives so Toy has a class and implements cloneable interface
- Bucket stores it so Bucket is also a class essentially IMO an ArrayList of Toys
